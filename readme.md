# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### redux-bundler codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://imnutz.github.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **redux-bundler** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **redux-bundler** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

Most of the work here is inspired by reading [Human Redux](https://read.reduxbook.com/)

The app adapts the structure from [redux-bundler](https://reduxbundler.com/)
